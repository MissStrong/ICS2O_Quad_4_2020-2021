## Size and Speed Measurements

The following prefixes are often used when measuring size or speed in computing.

| Prefix | Quantity    | Quantity as a Power of 10 |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Kilo   | Thousand    | 10<sup>3</sup>            |
| Mega   | Million     | 10<sup>6</sup>            |
| Giga   | Billion     | 10<sup>9</sup>            |
| Tera   | Trillion    | 10<sup>12</sup>           |
| Peta   | Quadrillion | 10<sup>15</sup>           |
| Exa    | Quintillion | 10<sup>18</sup>           |
| Zetta  | Sextillion  | 10<sup>21</sup>           |
| Yotta  | Septillion  | 10<sup>24</sup>           |

### Size Measurements

Computers use binary code to represent and store data. Every thing you see and do on a computer is stored as a massive list of zeros and ones. The amount of space a file or app takes up depends on how many zeros and ones are needed to represent it

A **bit** is the smallest unit of size measurement in computing. One bit represents a single binary digit: 0 or 1. The word "bit" comes from letters in **b**inary dig**it**.

Eight bits is equivalent to one byte. The most common characters in English including unaccented letters, common punctuation marks, and single-digit numerals take up one byte.

The vast majority of characters you'll ever use take up 4 bytes or less. Examples include foreign chracters, math symbols, wingdings and emojis. 

| Name     | Acronym | Size       |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Kilobyte | KB      | 1000 bytes |
| Megabyte | MB      | 1000 KB    |
| Gigabyte | GB      | 1000 MB    |
| Terabyte | TB      | 1000 GB    |
| Petabyte | PB      | 1000 TB    |

Software is often described as 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit. Software that is 32-bit have over 4 billion possible values that can be stored, whereas 64-bit have over 18.4 quintillion. 

### Speed Measurments

The speed of computers can be measured in terms of **hertz** (Hz).

Computers update based on cycles. One hertz is equivalent to each cycle taking one second.

| Name      | Acronym | Size                        |
| --------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| Kilohertz | KHz     | 1000 cycles/second          |
| Megahertz | MHz     | 1 000 000 cycles/second     |
| Gigahertz | GHz     | 1 000 000 000 cycles/second |
