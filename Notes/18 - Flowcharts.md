**Flowcharts** are diagrams that visually demonstrate an algorithm that involves decision making. Here is an example:

### Flowchart Symbols

There are over 20 standard symbols used in flowcharts, but you only need to know these four for this activity.

| Symbol                                       | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](../../Images/Oval.png)<br>Oval           | A start or end point.                                        |
| ![](../../Images/Diamond.png)<br>Diamond     | A question being asked.                                      |
| ![](../../Images/Rectangle.png)<br>Rectangle | An action or process.                                        |

### Creating Flowcharts 

Here are a few examples of flowchart-making softward:

* [Google Drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/)
* Microsoft Office software (e.g. Word, Powerpoint, Publisher, etc.) using the **Shapes** tool
* [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)

Drawing them by hand isn't too bad, either.
