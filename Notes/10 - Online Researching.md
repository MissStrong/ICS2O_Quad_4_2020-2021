## Online Researching

Online researching is an important lifelong skill. The Internet is a vast space full of information, some of which is true and some of which is not. When looking at information on the Internet, it is crucial to think critically about the credibility of the sources you are using to attain information.

### The CRAAP Test

To assess the credibility of a source, you can use the CRAAP Test. CRAAP stands for **C**urrency, **R**elevancy, **A**uthority, **A**ccuracy, and **P**urpose. By finding out each of these pieces of information, you can make an informed decision about whether the source is credible.

### Researching Tips

- Check the dates of articles
- Learn more about the author of articles
- Recognize when an article is an opinion piece or a satirical piece
- Cross-check questionable information with a variety of different sources
- Use academic databases to find published papers
- Use scientific papers to get scientific data
- Use the [advanced search](https://www.google.ca/advanced_search) feature on Google to get relevant results
- Avoid blogs and personal websites

### Citation

In every research assignment, you are expected to **cite** your sources. By doing this, you are showing recognition to the sources that you got your information and ideas from. Simply stating the URL is not enough; you need to use a **citation style**.

There are many citation styles. Here are some of the most common ones.

- APA (American Psychological Association); used for Education, Psychology, and Sciences
- MLA (Modern Language Association); used for the Humanities
- Chicago; used for Business, History, and the Fine Arts

The style you are supposed to use may depend on what your topic of research is. When you have a choice between styles, APA or MLA are typically safe options.

The information about each citation style is from a webpage on the University of Pittsburgh's website. Here is what each citation style looks like for this source.
